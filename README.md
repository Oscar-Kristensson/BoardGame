# BoardGame

is a tool for automating stoichiometric calculations by automatically calculating the mass, molarmass, amount of substance, concentration, volume and more.

## Usage and installation
### VS 2022
Run the following script:

``` bash
scripts/vs
```

The script will run cmake automatically and remove the old files. After running the script, open the generated solution file in VS and compile as normal. 

### Cmake
Run cmake :)

### Generate Assets
(This is game specific and should not be here)
Currently all assets are created as SVG:s. To render them out you can use the following python scripts:
``` bash
python scripts/renderAssets.py
```
The script requires inkscape to be installed and that the correct path is in the script.
